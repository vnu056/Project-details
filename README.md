The proposed Hybrid GA-PSO Optimization Approach is simulated with a system output voltage of 11 kV and 100 MVA power rating.
Advantages:
1.	Fewer components needed: The hybrid method optimizes placement of capacitors (CAP) and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) efficiently.
2.	Improved system performance: Reduces power loss and improves voltage levels across the grid.
3.	Cost-effective: Maximizes financial savings by reducing energy loss and considering installation and maintenance costs.
4.	Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) enabled: EVs can send power back to the grid during high demand, improving grid stability.
Working:
Four cases were studied:
1.	Base case (no EVCS or CAP).
2.	EVCS added.
3.	Both EVCS and CAP added.
4.	EVCS with V2G mode.
Simulations were conducted, and results showed reduced power loss and improved voltage.
Key Specifications:
•	Systems tested: IEEE 33, 69, 85, 118, and Brazil 136-bus.
•	Power rating: 100 MVA.
•	Operating voltage: 11 kV.
Results:
Significant reductions in power loss and cost savings were observed across all systems, with the hybrid method performing better than other algorithms.
Disadvantage:
Convergence time is slightly longer for larger systems.
Applications:
This method is useful for Electric Vehicle Charging, Smart Grids, Renewable Energy, and Military Power Systems, ensuring better grid reliability and efficiency.
